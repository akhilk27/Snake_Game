# Snake_Game
This is a simple Snake game built using Python and the Turtle module.

## How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
- Eat the food to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Snake-Game.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```
   cd Snake-Game
   ```

3. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. Install the Required Libraries:

   Ensure you have the Turtle module installed. It's included in the Python standard library, so no additional installation is required for most users. If using an IDE like PyCharm, it should work out of the box.
   

6. Run the Game:

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

## Requirements

Python 3.x

Turtle (part of the Python standard library)

## Notes

Make sure your Python installation includes the Turtle module.

If you encounter issues, ensure that all files (main.py, snake.py, food.py, score.py) are in the same directory.
